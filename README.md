## Deployment

<br>

### Deploying to Netlify

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

- `npm run build`

Your app is ready to be deployed!

You could also host directly with Netlify by linking your own repository.
